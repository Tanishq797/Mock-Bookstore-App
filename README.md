Created a Bookstore App with 2 other members which essentially allows users to simulate the purchasing of items in an actual online store with points instead of currency. Created using JavaFX for UI and functionality.

Project implemented the following OOP principles:
- Design Patterns (Singleton + Observable Design Patterns)
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

Features:
- User authentication for both customers and the owner (no hashing, just plain-text)
- Add + remove books (updates throughout program)
- Add + remove customers (updates throughout program)
- Points system for customers to earn and spend points
- Purchase book(s) (regular), 
- Purchase book(s) (redeem points)

NOTE: To run the project, ensure you have JDK and JavaFX installed
